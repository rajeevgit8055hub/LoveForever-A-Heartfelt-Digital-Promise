## ❤️ Love Forever – A Heartfelt Digital Expression of Endless Love

I’m so happy to share my special frontend experiment — a heartfelt digital love letter crafted entirely for *Ritu and Awdhesh*, designed and developed with pure **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**.

This heartfelt creation softly weaves endless love into pure lines of HTML, gentle layers of CSS, and delicate touches of JavaScript.
Each tiny animation — from twinkling stars to floating hearts — whispers feelings that words alone could never hold.
Together, they create a living promise that true love — the love of Ritu and Awdhesh — shines, drifts, rises, and stays forever.

This isn’t just code — it’s a gentle love story written under a dreamy night sky with twinkling stars, floating hearts, a glowing moon, and a falling star — a soft reminder that true love is endless, just like the sky that always holds them close.
